    <h1 align="center">ART</h1>
    <p1>Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or 
        conceptual ideas.</p1>
    <br>
    <p2>There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. The three classical branches ofvisual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. Theatre, dance, and 
        other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts. Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. 
        In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts. The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity 
        and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics. The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.</p2>

        <br>
        Extreme Formalism is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form).

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentionalism_(disambiguation)">Extreme Intentionalism:</a>
        <br>
        Extreme Intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.

        <br>
        Finally, the developing theory of post-structuralism studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.
